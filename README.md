# Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

## Slide 1: Title Slide
- Title: "Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques"
- Subtitle: "Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought Prompting"

## Slide 2: Introduction
- Brief overview of prompt engineering
- Importance in AI interactions

## Slide 3: Zero-Shot Prompting
- Definition: Asking the model to perform a task without any examples or prior training
- Key characteristics:
  - No examples provided
  - Relies on model's general knowledge
- Use cases: General knowledge tasks, simple instructions

## Slide 4: Zero-Shot Prompting Example
- Example prompt: "Explain the process of photosynthesis."
- Pros:
  - Quick to implement
  - Versatile for various topics
- Cons:
  - May lack precision for specialized tasks

## Slide 5: Few-Shot Prompting
- Definition: Providing the model with a few examples before asking it to perform a similar task
- Key characteristics:
  - 2-3 examples typically provided
  - Examples demonstrate desired format or reasoning
- Use cases: Specific or nuanced tasks, format-specific outputs

## Slide 6: Few-Shot Prompting Example
- Example prompt:
  Input: "Happy" -> Output: "Joyful"
  Input: "Sad" -> Output: "Melancholy"
  Input: "Angry" -> Now you try: ...
- Pros:
  - Improves performance on specific tasks
  - Helps model understand expected output format
- Cons:
  - Requires careful example selection
  - May bias model towards specific patterns

## Slide 7: Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- Definition: Guiding the model to break down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning processes
- Key characteristics:
  - Encourages step-by-step problem-solving
  - Mimics human reasoning processes
- Use cases: Multi-step problems, logical reasoning, mathematical tasks

## Slide 8: Chain-of-Thought Prompting Example
- Example prompt: "Solve this math problem step by step: If a train travels 120 km in 2 hours, what is its average speed in km/h?"
- Pros:
  - Enhances performance on complex problems
  - Provides transparent reasoning process
- Cons:
  - Can be verbose for simple queries
  - May introduce errors if steps are flawed

## Slide 9: Comparison of Techniques
- Table comparing Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought:
  | Technique       | Complexity | Precision | Use Case                    |
  |-----------------|------------|-----------|----------------------------|
  | Zero-Shot       | Low        | Moderate  | General knowledge          |
  | Few-Shot        | Moderate   | High      | Specific, formatted tasks  |
  | Chain-of-Thought| High       | Very High | Complex, multi-step problems |
